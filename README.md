Ask @thisdarktao anything!

I've created this repository (inspired by [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo/ama)) to continue learning, exchanging information, critiques and comments right in the open. This is in lieu of the usual blog comment systems, email and contact forms.

Seriously, _anything_. Want to correct me on my website content? No problem, glad to have your feedback! Have a content suggestion? Bring it on. Want to reminisce about Half-Life and the golden age of PC gaming? I'm down for that. Sending me a thank you? I'd love that.

## Ask a question

Asking a question is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/thisdarktao/ama/issues/new) on this project.

I'll try to answer it as soon as I can get to it. Once I answer I'll close the issue just so I know what I've covered, but don't worry- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and I'll get back to you soon. Feel free to ask a question on any old issue too, even if you didn't create it.

## Read some questions

Check out the [Closed Issues](https://github.com/thisdarktao/ama/issues?sort=created&direction=desc&state=closed&page=1) filter on this repository to browse questions I've answered in the past. I try to use this as an email replacement that everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.
